    <h1>You want accounts to do what now?</h1>
    <p>What started out as, "This customer needs a way to manage their changing teams and view usage," unveiled itself as a need to evolve the "My Account" section across the board. Our customer base and product suite had matured past the current setup, which was still based on single user accounts.</p>
    <p>As larger organizations leveraged Whitepages Pro, we saw (and had a few customers vocalize) a need for role stratification and advanced usage info in order to reflect their team's structure and workflow. This impression was further confirmed in face-to-face interviews and observations with customers.</p>
